--- Body for control-flow operations.
--
-- Once invoked, this will spin on a test / update loop until told to terminate. On each
-- iteration, if it did not terminate, it will yield.
-- @tparam ?|callable|nil update Update logic, called as
--    result = update(arg1, arg2, arg3)
-- after _done_. If **nil**, this is a no-op.
--
-- If _result_ is **"done"**, the body will terminate early.
-- @callable done Test, with same signature as _update_, called on each iteration. When
-- _result_ resolves to true (by default, if it is true), the loop terminates.
-- @ptable config Configuration parameters.
--
-- If the **negate_done** field is true, the _result_ from _done_ is negated, i.e. instead
-- of "until test passes" the loop is interpreted as "while test passes", and vice versa.
--
-- If a **yvalue** field is present, this value is yielded after each iteration. If absent,
-- this defaults to **"keep"**, as a convenience for coroutine-based @{TaskQueue} tasks.
-- @param arg1 Argument #1.
-- @param arg2 Argument #2.
-- @param arg3 Argument #3.
-- @treturn boolean Operation completed normally, i.e. _done_ resolved true?

--- Timed variant of @{Body}.
--
-- The current time lapse behavior at the time of the call will be used throughout the body,
-- even if @{SetTimeLapseFuncs} is called again before the body has concluded.
--
-- Logically, this body maintains a counter, _time_, which begins at 0. On each iteration,
-- time lapse function is polled for a value, _lapse_, &ge; 0. After test / update, if the
-- body-based operation has not concluded, _time_ will be incremented by _lapse_ (possibly
-- reduced by _update_ and / or _done_), just before the body yields for that iteration.
--
-- On each iteration, the final value of _lapse_ will also be deducted from the "time bank",
-- before yielding or returning.
-- @tparam ?|callable|nil update As per @{Body}, but called as
--    result, true_lapse = update(time_state, arg1, arg2, arg3)
-- If _result_ is **"done"**, _true\_lapse_ is also considered. If present, it indicates how
-- much time actually passed before the update terminated, and will replace the current time
-- lapse (assuming it is a shorter lapse and non-negative).
--
-- _time\_state_ is a table with the following fields:
--
-- * **time**: The current value of _time_.
-- * **lapse**: The current value of _lapse_ (possibly reduced by _done_).
--
-- @callable done Test performed on each iteration, called as
--    is_done[, true_lapse] = done([time_state, ]arg1, arg2, arg3)
-- If _is\_done_ is true, the loop is ready to terminate. In that case, _true\_lapse_ may
-- also be considered, as per _update_; otherwise, the amount is assumed to be 0, i.e. the
-- loop terminated instantly. If _true\_lapse_ &gt; 0, _update_ will still be called, using
-- the narrowed time lapse.
--
-- _time\_state_ is as per _update_, except the **lapse** amount will be the initial value
-- for the current iteration.
--
-- @ptable config As per @{Body}, though a **use_time** field is also examined. If this is
-- true, _done_ accepts the _time\_state_ argument and handles _true\_lapse_ on termination.
-- @param arg1 Argument #1.
-- @param arg2 Argument #2.
-- @param arg3 Argument #3.
-- @treturn boolean Operation concluded normally?

-- The lapse function tells us how much time is available **right now** to run a timed body
-- operation. It may be the case that only some of this is needed: a useful abstraction
-- here is a "time bank", where the "balance"&mdash;viz. the entire time slice&mdash;is
-- reported, then the deduct function is told how much to "withdraw".
--
-- In this way, say, a 10-millisecond wait need not consume a 100-millisecond time slice.
-- Indeed, two consecutive 10-millisecond waits could run and still leave more: the lapse
-- would first report 100 milliseconds available, then 90, and so on.

-- lapse amount and deducts it from the "time bank"; or **nil** to restore the default (a
